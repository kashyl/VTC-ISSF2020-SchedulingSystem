User System:
Implement ASP.NET Core Identity
Hash passwords before saving to DB
Add authentication and authorization
User should be authorized to view "private" pages once they have been authenticated
Cookies, session etc.

User can then schedule a room through an online form, the form data is sent to the DB
User can edit or cancel the scheduling of a room if the schedule has been created by them, or if their role permits it
Users can see which rooms are already booked by another user, but they shouldn't be able to see the details if they are not allowed.
